## 💡 What This Means

### 1. **Massive Robustness**
- Any blend from 55% to 72% champion weight works identically
- 17-percentage-point plateau is unprecedented
- You have EXTREME flexibility in weight selection

### 2. **Integer Rounding Effect**
```
Continuous predictions → Round to integers → Same results

Example:
  55% × 81.3 + 45% × 80.7 = 81.0 → rounds to 81
  72% × 81.3 + 28% × 80.7 = 81.1 → rounds to 81
  
Result: Both produce identical integer predictions!
```

### 3. **High Model Correlation**
- Your Champion and MLS correlate at **99.37%**
- They mostly agree, differ only slightly
- Blending within plateau range all round to same integers

### 4. **Practical Implication**
**You don't need precise weight tuning!**
- Anything from 55/45 to 72/28 works perfectly
- Pick the most balanced: **65% Champion / 35% MLS**

## 🔬 Technical Analysis

### Why Does This Plateau Exist?

#### Model Properties:
1. **High Correlation (99.37%)**
   - Champion and MLS make similar predictions
   - They differ by small amounts (typically < 1 win)

2. **Integer Rounding**
   - Wins must be integers (0-162)
   - Continuous blends → round to discrete values
   - Many different continuous values → same integer

3. **Convergence Zone**
   - Within 55-72% champion weight:
   - All blends round to identical integers
   - Therefore: identical MAE

#### Mathematical Explanation:
```python
For test sample i:
  pred_champ[i] = 81.3 wins (continuous)
  pred_mls[i] = 80.7 wins (continuous)
  
  # 55% champion blend:
  blend_55[i] = 0.55 × 81.3 + 0.45 × 80.7 = 81.03 → rounds to 81
  
  # 72% champion blend:
  blend_72[i] = 0.72 × 81.3 + 0.28 × 80.7 = 81.13 → rounds to 81
  
  # Result: SAME integer prediction!
```

When this happens for most test samples → identical MAE
