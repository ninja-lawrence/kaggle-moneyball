# Generate Three Best Models - Complete Process

## Overview
The file `generate_three_best_models.py` is a **SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE FILE** that does EVERYTHING:
- ✅ Generates three base models from scratch
- ✅ Creates the winning 50/30/20 blend
- ✅ Fine-tunes with variant weight combinations
- ✅ Produces 9 total submission files ready for Kaggle

## What This File Does

Instead of:
1. Running `app_notemporal.py` → CSV
2. Running `app_multi_ensemble.py` → CSV  
3. Running `app_finetuned.py` → CSV
4. Running `finetune_winning_blend.py` to blend them

You now have **ONE FILE** that does it all in a single execution! 

## Complete Pipeline in One File

### Part 1: Model 1 - No-Temporal Features
- **Strategy**: Exclude decade/era features to prevent overfitting
- **Features**: Universal baseball metrics (Pythagorean expectation, run differential, offensive/pitching metrics)
- **Optimization**: Tests both StandardScaler and RobustScaler with multiple alpha values
- **Output**: `submission_notemporal.csv` (~3.03 expected)

### Part 2: Model 2 - Multi-Model Ensemble
- **Strategy**: Combine two models trained on different feature sets
  - Feature Set 1: Pythagorean-focused features
  - Feature Set 2: Volume/efficiency metrics
- **Optimization**: Cross-validation to find optimal ensemble weights
- **Output**: `submission_multi_ensemble.csv` (~3.04 expected)

### Part 3: Model 3 - Fine-Tuned
- **Strategy**: Extensive alpha search + multi-seed ensemble for stability
- **Features**: Balanced feature set with 6 Pythagorean exponents
- **Optimization**: Tests 16 different alpha values, then averages predictions across 5 random seeds
- **Output**: `submission_finetuned.csv` (~3.02 expected)

### Part 4: Create Champion Blend
- Combines the three base models with winning weights:
  ```
  50% notemporal + 30% multi + 20% finetuned = 2.99 MAE ✅
  ```
- **Output**: `submission_blended_best.csv` (THE CHAMPION!)

### Part 5: Fine-Tune with Variants
- Tests 81 weight combinations around the winning formula
- Creates 5 promising variants that differ from champion
- Explores alternative weight distributions that might achieve 2.98 or better
- **Outputs**: 
  - `submission_blend_variant_a.csv` (45/35/20)
  - `submission_blend_variant_b.csv` (52/28/20)
  - `submission_blend_variant_c.csv` (48/32/20)
  - `submission_blend_variant_d.csv` (47/30/23)
  - `submission_blend_variant_e.csv` (53/27/20)

## Key Insight

The 30% weight on multi-ensemble is critical - even though it scores 3.04 alone, it provides diversity that improves the blend to 2.99!

## How to Use

**Run the complete pipeline with ONE command**:
```bash
python generate_three_best_models.py
```

That's it! This single command:
1. ✅ Generates three base models from scratch
2. ✅ Creates the winning 50/30/20 blend
3. ✅ Tests 81 weight variations
4. ✅ Produces 5 high-potential variant blends
5. ✅ Outputs 9 total submission files ready for Kaggle

## File Comparison

| Old Approach (4 separate files) | New Approach (1 file) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| `app_notemporal.py` → CSV | ✅ Built-in Part 1 |
| `app_multi_ensemble.py` → CSV | ✅ Built-in Part 2 |
| `app_finetuned.py` → CSV | ✅ Built-in Part 3 |
| `finetune_winning_blend.py` | ✅ Built-in Parts 4-5 |
| **Run 4 scripts** | **Run 1 script** |
| **Load pre-made CSVs** | **Generate everything fresh** |

## Benefits

✅ **Single file solution** - ONE script does everything  
✅ **Complete transparency** - See entire pipeline from data to submissions  
✅ **No dependencies** - Doesn't rely on pre-generated CSVs  
✅ **Reproducible** - Generate fresh predictions anytime  
✅ **Educational** - Understand the complete process  
✅ **Efficient** - Loads data once, reuses for all models  
✅ **9 submissions** - Base models + champion + 5 variants  

## Output Files (9 total)

### Base Models (3)
1. `submission_notemporal.csv` - No temporal features approach
2. `submission_multi_ensemble.csv` - Multi-model ensemble
3. `submission_finetuned.csv` - Fine-tuned with multi-seed averaging

### Champion Blend (1)
4. `submission_blended_best.csv` - **The 2.99 champion!** ✅

### Variant Blends (5)
5. `submission_blend_variant_a.csv` - 45/35/20 weights
6. `submission_blend_variant_b.csv` - 52/28/20 weights
