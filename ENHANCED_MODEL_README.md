# 🚀 Enhanced Champion Model

## Overview

Based on `generate_champion_complete.py` (2.97530 MAE), this enhanced version adds advanced machine learning techniques to push performance even further.

## File Created

**`generate_champion_enhanced.py`** - Advanced one-file solution with multiple improvements

## 🆕 Key Improvements

### 1. **Advanced Feature Engineering**
- **Expanded Pythagorean variations**: 6 different exponents (1.75, 1.83, 1.85, 1.9, 1.95, 2.0)
- **Non-linear transformations**: Squared features, log transforms for capturing complex patterns
- **Advanced offensive metrics**: 
  - Isolated Power (ISO)
  - Extra Base Hit rate (XBH)
  - wOBA approximation (weighted on-base average)
  - Contact rate
- **Pitcher efficiency metrics**:
  - K/BB ratio
  - H/9, BB/9, K/9, HR/9
  - Enhanced WHIP calculations
- **Feature interactions**: 
  - Runs per hit
  - HR run contribution
  - SO/BB differential and ratios
  - Defense efficiency ratios

### 2. **Multiple Model Types**
Instead of just Ridge regression:
- ✅ **Ridge** with feature selection (top 80 features)
- ✅ **Gradient Boosting** (sklearn implementation)
- ✅ **XGBoost** (if installed) - state-of-the-art gradient boosting
- ✅ **LightGBM** (if installed) - faster gradient boosting
- ✅ **ElasticNet** (L1 + L2 regularization)

### 3. **Advanced Ensemble Techniques**

#### A. **Stacked Meta-Learner**
- Generates out-of-fold predictions from base models
- Trains a meta-model (Ridge) to learn optimal combination
- Uses positive weights (non-negative constraint)
- More sophisticated than simple averaging

#### B. **Optimal Weighted Blend**
- Grid search over weight space
- Finds best combination using OOF validation
- Focuses weights on best-performing models

#### C. **Simple Average Ensemble**
- Equal-weight baseline for comparison

### 4. **Improved Cross-Validation**
- **Stratified K-Fold**: Groups by win bins to ensure representative splits
- Prevents data leakage in meta-learning
- More robust performance estimation

### 5. **Feature Selection**
- SelectKBest using f_regression scores
- Reduces overfitting by keeping only top predictive features
- Tested with polynomial features (disabled by default for speed)

### 6. **Multiple Submissions**
Saves 4 different submission files for testing:
1. `submission_enhanced_best.csv` - Best CV-performing ensemble (recommended)
2. `submission_enhanced_stacked.csv` - Stacked meta-learner
3. `submission_enhanced_simple_avg.csv` - Simple average
4. `submission_enhanced_optimal.csv` - Grid-search optimized weights

## 📊 Expected Performance

The enhanced model should achieve:
- **CV MAE**: ~2.95-2.97 range
- **Goal**: Beat 2.97530 baseline
- **Best case**: 2.94-2.96 (1-2% improvement)

## 🎯 How to Use

### Basic Usage (No extra installs needed)
```bash
python generate_champion_enhanced.py
```

This will work with just pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn (same as champion model).

### Enhanced Usage (with XGBoost/LightGBM)

For best results, install gradient boosting libraries:

```bash
# Install XGBoost
pip install xgboost

# Install LightGBM  
pip install lightgbm

# Then run
python generate_champion_enhanced.py
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Feature Engineering Philosophy
1. **Proven patterns**: Keeps champion's Pythagorean core
2. **Non-linearity**: Adds squared, log, and interaction terms
3. **Domain knowledge**: Baseball-specific metrics (wOBA, ISO, K/BB)
4. **Robustness**: Handles missing values and outliers

### Model Diversity
- **Linear models** (Ridge, ElasticNet): Capture linear relationships
- **Tree models** (GB, XGB, LGB): Capture non-linear patterns and interactions
- **Ensemble**: Combines strengths of both approaches

### Meta-Learning Strategy
```
Base Models (Level 0)
  ├─ Ridge (linear patterns)
  ├─ GradientBoosting (non-linear)
  ├─ XGBoost (advanced boosting)
  ├─ LightGBM (fast boosting)
  └─ ElasticNet (sparse solutions)
           ↓
  Meta-Model (Level 1)
  └─ Ridge with positive weights
           ↓
    Final Predictions
```

## 📈 Performance Comparison

| Approach | Description | Expected MAE |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Champion Baseline | 3-model blend (37/44/19) | 2.97530 |
| Enhanced Stacked | Meta-learner ensemble | 2.95-2.96 |
| Enhanced Optimal | Grid-search weights | 2.95-2.97 |
| Enhanced Simple | Equal-weight average | 2.96-2.98 |

## 🔍 What to Try Next

If enhanced model doesn't beat 2.97530:

1. **Adjust feature selection**:
   - Try k=60, 100, 120 features
   - Use different selection methods (mutual_info_regression)

2. **Tune hyperparameters**:
   - XGBoost: max_depth (3-6), learning_rate (0.01-0.1)
   - GradientBoosting: n_estimators (100-500)

3. **Polynomial features**:
   - Uncomment polynomial feature creation
   - Try degree=2 interactions

4. **Weight search**:
   - Expand grid search range
   - Try finer granularity (0.01 steps)

5. **Model combinations**:
   - Try only tree models
   - Try only linear models
   - Blend champion models with enhanced models

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Might Work
1. **Diversity**: Tree models capture different patterns than Ridge
2. **Non-linearity**: Squared and log features help with complex relationships
3. **Meta-learning**: Learns optimal combination from data
4. **Feature selection**: Reduces noise from irrelevant features

### Why This Might Not Work
1. **Overfitting**: More complex models might overfit small dataset
2. **Plateau**: Champion already at optimal point
3. **Domain constraints**: Baseball wins might be inherently predictable only to ~2.97 MAE
