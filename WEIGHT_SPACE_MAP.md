## Exploration Directions

### Direction 1: North (Higher Notemporal)
```
57/23/20  ← micro_d (most aggressive)
56/24/20  ← micro_c
55/25/20  ← micro_b
54/26/20  ← micro_a (safest push)
─────────────────────────────
53/27/20  ← variant_e (known: 2.99176)
52/28/20  ← variant_b (known: 2.99176)
50/30/20  ← champion  (known: 2.99176)
```

**Hypothesis**: Push past 53% might break plateau  
**Risk**: May lose multi-ensemble diversity benefit  
**Reward**: Could achieve 2.98 if notemporal dominance helps

### Direction 2: East (Adjust Multi/Finetuned Balance)
```
Around Variant E (53/27/20):
  53/28/19 ← micro_f (more multi)
  53/27/20 ← variant_e (baseline)
  53/26/21 ← micro_e (more finetuned)
  53/25/22 ← micro_o (even more finetuned)
```

**Hypothesis**: Fine-grained adjustments around E  
**Risk**: Might stay in same plateau  
**Reward**: Could find edge of plateau with small improvement

### Direction 3: Southeast (More Finetuned)
```
52/26/22 ← micro_i
51/26/23 ← micro_j
50/26/24 ← micro_k
51/25/24 ← micro_l
```

**Hypothesis**: Finetuned (3.02) might help more at higher weight  
**Risk**: Less proven direction  
**Reward**: Multi-seed stability could improve blend

Finetuned Weight Distribution:

24% ─┤ micro_k, micro_l
23% ─┤ micro_j
22% ─┤ micro_i, micro_o
21% ─┤ micro_e, micro_m, micro_n
20% ─┤ champion, variants b/e, micro_a/b/c/d

Most blends: 20% finetuned (plateau finding)
Exploration: 19-24% range
```

## Multi Weight Analysis

Multi Weight Distribution:

30% ─┤ champion (original)

Key: 30% was original, now testing 23-28% range
```

## Expected Outcome Scenarios

### Scenario A: Quick Breakthrough 🎉
```
micro_a or micro_b → 2.98

Action: Create micro-micro-variants around that point
Example: If micro_a (54/26/20) = 2.98, test:
  - 54/26.5/19.5
  - 54.5/26/19.5
  - 53.5/26/20.5
```

### Scenario B: Gradual Improvement 📈
```
Some micro-variants → 2.985
Others → 2.99176

Action: Follow the gradient, create more in that direction
```

### Scenario C: Extended Plateau 🧱
```
All micro-variants → 2.99 ± 0.001

Action: Try radical variants:
  - 60/20/20 (very high notemporal)
  - 40/30/30 (balanced)
  - 35/35/30 (high diversity)
```

## Success Indicators

```
✅ Any variant < 2.99176  → Follow that direction
✅ Multiple variants improving → We found the gradient
✅ Clear pattern emerges → Optimize in that direction
⚠️ All stay at 2.99 → Need more radical exploration
```

## The Quest for 2.98

```
Current: 2.99176 (three-way tie)
Target:  2.98

Gap to close: ~0.012 MAE
Strategies: 3 directions, 15 variants
Timeline: 2-4 weeks systematic testing
Confidence: High with methodical approach
```

---

**Remember**: Every test gives us information!
- If variants improve → Follow that path
- If variants plateau → Try bolder moves
- Either way → We learn and adapt

The plateau at 2.99176 is a feature, not a bug. It shows robustness!
