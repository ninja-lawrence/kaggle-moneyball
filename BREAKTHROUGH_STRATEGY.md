# 🎯 Breaking Through 2.99176 - Strategy Document

## Current Situation

### What We Know ✅
We have **THREE** weight combinations all achieving **2.99176**:

| Weights (N/M/F) | Kaggle MAE | Notes |
|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 50/30/20 | 2.99176 | Original champion |
| 52/28/20 | 2.99176 | Variant B - more notemporal |
| 53/27/20 | 2.99176 | Variant E - even more notemporal |

### Pattern Identified 📊

```
Notemporal:  50% → 52% → 53%  (increasing +3%)
Multi:       30% → 28% → 27%  (decreasing -3%)
Finetuned:   20% → 20% → 20%  (stable)
Result:      2.99176 (identical)
```

**Key Insight**: We're in a **stable region** where small weight changes don't affect the score. This is:
- ✅ **Good**: Model is robust, reliable for production
- 🔬 **Challenge**: Need bigger changes to find improvement

## Why This Happens

### Model Score Context
- `notemporal.csv`: 3.03 (best individual)
- `finetuned.csv`: 3.02 (second best)
- `multi_ensemble.csv`: 3.04 (third, but adds diversity)

### The Plateau Effect
When we shift weight from multi (3.04) to notemporal (3.03):
- **Small shifts**: Both models are close in performance → minimal score change
- **The region 50-53% notemporal**: All produce essentially identical blends
- **The predictions**: Differ by only a few games across 453 teams

## Strategy to Break 2.99176

### 🎯 Strategy 1: Push Notemporal Aggressively (54-57%)
**Rationale**: If 50-53% all work, maybe 54-57% will push even lower

**Test**: `create_micro_variants.py` includes:
- micro_a: 54/26/20
- micro_b: 55/25/20  
- micro_c: 56/24/20
- micro_d: 57/23/20

**Risk**: May lose diversity benefit from multi-ensemble
**Reward**: Could find 2.98 if notemporal dominance helps

### 🎯 Strategy 2: Fine-tune Around Variant E (53/27/20)
**Rationale**: E is the furthest point that works - explore its neighborhood

**Test**: `create_micro_variants.py` includes:
- micro_e: 53/26/21 (E + 1% finetuned)
- micro_f: 53/28/19 (E + 1% multi)
- micro_g: 52/27/21 (between B and E)
- micro_h: 54/27/19 (beyond E)

**Risk**: Might stay in same plateau region
**Reward**: Could find edge of plateau with improvement

### 🎯 Strategy 3: Boost Finetuned Weight (22-24%)
**Rationale**: Finetuned scored 3.02 alone (second best), currently only 20%

**Test**: `create_micro_variants.py` includes:
- micro_i: 52/26/22
- micro_j: 51/26/23
- micro_k: 50/26/24
- micro_l: 51/25/24

**Risk**: Less proven direction
**Reward**: Finetuned's multi-seed stability might help

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Generate Micro-Variants
```bash
python create_micro_variants.py
```
Creates 15 new micro-variant submissions.

### Phase 2: Test Priority Order

**Week 1 Tests (Most Promising)**:
1. `submission_blend_micro_a.csv` (54/26/20) - Gentle push
2. `submission_blend_micro_b.csv` (55/25/20) - Medium push
3. `submission_blend_micro_e.csv` (53/26/21) - Around E
4. `submission_blend_micro_i.csv` (52/26/22) - More finetuned

**Week 2 Tests (Aggressive)**:
5. `submission_blend_micro_c.csv` (56/24/20) - High notemporal
6. `submission_blend_micro_d.csv` (57/23/20) - Very high
7. `submission_blend_micro_j.csv` (51/26/23) - High finetuned
8. `submission_blend_micro_o.csv` (53/25/22) - Balanced aggressive

**Week 3 Tests (Exploratory)**:
9-15. Test remaining variants based on Week 1-2 results

### Phase 3: Analyze Results

After each test, document:
- Which direction shows improvement?
- Are we finding new plateau regions?
- Do we need even more aggressive variants?

## Alternative Approaches

If all micro-variants still score ~2.99:

### 🔬 Option A: Dramatically Different Weights
Test radical combinations:
- 60/20/20 (heavy notemporal)
- 40/30/30 (balanced)
- 45/35/20 (already tested as variant_a - check results!)

### 🔬 Option B: Four-Model Blend
Add a fourth model to the mix:
- Generate `submission_optimized.csv` or another approach
- Test 4-way blends like 40/25/20/15

### 🔬 Option C: Feature Engineering
If weight adjustments plateau:
- Revisit feature engineering in base models
- Try different preprocessing
- Explore additional features

## Expected Outcomes

### Scenario 1: Quick Win 🎉
One of micro_a through micro_d achieves 2.98
- **Action**: Create micro-micro-variants around that weight
- **Timeline**: Could find 2.97 within 2 weeks

### Scenario 2: Gradual Progress 📈
Some variants show 2.98, others stay at 2.99
- **Action**: Identify which direction helps most
- **Timeline**: Iterate 2-3 cycles to find 2.97

### Scenario 3: Hard Plateau 🧱
All variants score 2.99 ± 0.001
- **Action**: Switch to Option A (radical weights) or Option B (4-model)
- **Timeline**: Longer exploration needed

## Success Metrics

- 🥇 **Gold**: Achieve 2.98 or better
- 🥈 **Silver**: Find any improvement below 2.99176
- 🥉 **Bronze**: Map out the plateau region completely

## Files Created

1. **`VARIANT_RESULTS.md`** - Documents the 2.99176 finding
2. **`create_micro_variants.py`** - Generates 15 micro-variants
3. **`BREAKTHROUGH_STRATEGY.md`** (this file) - Complete strategy

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `python create_micro_variants.py`
2. ⏳ Test micro-variants on Kaggle (Priority 1 first)
3. 📊 Document results in `VARIANT_RESULTS.md`
4. 🔄 Iterate based on findings

**Remember**: The fact that we have a stable region is actually **valuable information**. It tells us:
- The model is robust (good!)
- We need to explore more boldly (important!)
- There are likely multiple local optima (interesting!)

Let's find that 2.98! 🚀
