## Quick Reference

### If You Want...

**Speed** → Use `create_champion_blend.py`
```bash
python create_champion_blend.py  # 1 second
```

**Completeness** → Use `generate_champion_complete.py`
```bash
python generate_champion_complete.py  # 30-60 seconds
```

**Either works!** Both achieve 2.97530 MAE 🏆

## The Key Insight

### The Counterintuitive Discovery

```
Model Performance vs Blend Weight:

Notemporal:     2.77 MAE → 37% weight (middle)
Multi-Ensemble: 2.84 MAE → 44% weight (highest!) ⭐
Fine-Tuned:     2.79 MAE → 19% weight (lowest)

Result: 2.97530 MAE (5.5% better than baseline)
```

**Why does the "worst" model get the highest weight?**

Because it has the highest **diversity** - it makes different errors that complement the other models, reducing overall error in the blend.

**Key Lesson**: Diversity > Individual Performance
